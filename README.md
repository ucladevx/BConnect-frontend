# BConnect

Webapp that aims the facilitate social networking between UCLA alumni 


## Current

Redux set up

Routing with react-router

Styles with Material UI

Dummy login/signup/logout with redux state (no backend connection)

Dummy map data displayed on front page map

Additional forms after sign up to get more information and location data

## Upcoming

Connect to backend API for data persistence, user creation, and authentication

Query user/location data from API and display to user on map interface

Dockerfile  (?)

Real time chat between friends

Add friends feature

Nice landing page

Better UI (pretty much redo everything, only minimal MaterialUI?)

## Running the code

Fork the code. Run 
```
npm install
```
then run
```
npm start
```
Note that the maps may not work because the Google Maps API key is in an ignored .env
